UnSupervised Learning
---------------------

Performed on data with no labels, we have only features
Find patterns in the data and group the data into natural groups (Clusters)
e.g. Finding clusters of customers by their purchase history, (clustering)

e.g. compressing the data using purchase pattern (dimensionality reduction)

Supervised ->Finding patterns for a prediction task 
e.g. dog/cat classifier

UnSupervised -> We find patterns in the data but without any specific prediction task in mind

- Cluster/Dimensionality reduction

			Income		Spending
	C1 -> 3-10 LPA 	|  	7-10k		Good
	C2 -> 7-15 LPA	|	20 - 30k	Careless
	C3 -> >20LPA	|	< 10k		Good
	C4 -> >30LPA	|	> 30k		Target 
	
	Result of clustering 
	---------------------
	We are able to create groups or clusters in our data that gives a decision insight into the data
	
	Model lift -> Predict profit 
	
	Targeted advertisement
	MBA (Market Basket Analysis)
	
	
	Basic idea is similar points are close to each other 
	
	Goal of Clustering
	--------------------
	To get good quality clusters
		- They are well seperated
		- They are tightly fit clusters
		
	Get actionable insights
	-----------------------
	
	
	How to evaluate the clusters 
	----------------------------
	
	1. Visually by graph (Scatter Plot)
			> 3D (PCA/TSNE)
	2. DunnIndex|Slihouett Score
		If DI/SC is high then cluster is better
		
	
	Most used Clustering Algorithms
	
	1. K-Means
	2. Agglomerative Clustering
	3. DBScan
	4. Spectral Clustering
