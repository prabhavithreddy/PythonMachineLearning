SMOT 
	Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
	Balance the outcome variable e.g. 0,1
	
	More the data better the predictions
	
Initial Modelling
	Try different models
	
Retrain the model (Delta Data) (Data which is generated post training i.e. train new data again)
Maintain the model by giving Delta Data

Improved modelling steps
	1. Hyper parameter tuning
	2. Cross Validation
	3. Grid Search
	4. Model interpretation
		Visualize (e.g. Decision Tree)
		Feature Importances
	5. Tools [Shap]
	
Deployment
	Streamlit - App Framework to deploy model, designed specially for machine learning engineers
	
Lab - Solving Imbalanced dataset

SVM requires scaling the data
