What is ML
	It is a software/program that can learn from experience
	ML gives ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed
	A set of tools for making inferences and prediction from data
	often inferences and prediction work togeather inferences help make prediction

	Learn pattern from existing data and apply to new data, e.g. spam detection

	Train -> Fit -> Predictions

	Traditional programming

	Data 	-> Computer	| -> Output
	Program ->			|

	Machine Learning

	Data 	-> Computer	| -> Program
	Output 		->			|

	Example Square Root finder

Deep Learning
aka neural network where basic unit are neurons
	Special area of ML and require more data
	Best where input are images or text
	e.g. predict box office revenue
