Hierarchial
-----------
1. Agglomerative
	Bottom up approach
	Initially each point in its own clusters
	repeatedly combine two nearest clusters into 1
	
2. Divisive
	Top down approach
	Start with one cluster and keep splitting recursively 


Agglomerative
-------------
The key operations is repeatedly combine two nearest clusters into a large cluster

Key question: how to determing the nearness of two clusters

Answer: Nearness of Clusters = Distance between the centroids of the clusters


Step 1:
Each point is its own cluster

   * *		xx

	DENDROGRAM
	
	e.g. species of animals
	Family tree of how species are evolved
	

When two clusters are considered nearer

1. Min Distance - Single Linkage
2. Max Distance -> Complete Linkage
3. Centroid Linkage -> Avg Linkage
4. WARD Linkagej
