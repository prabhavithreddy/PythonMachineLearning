DBScan
------

Density based clustering 
Works good if data has different sizez or densities 


> Non - Globular

arxiv.org -> DBScan Cluster

	2. Hyperparameters 

	1. EPS - Epsilon 
	2. min_samples 


	EPS - Like radius of a circle 
		Is the most important hyperparameter
		The maximum distance between two samples
		
	min_samples
		No.of samples in the neighborhood to be considered as cluster
		
		
Steps of DBScan
---------------
1. Randomly select a starting point with given EPS & min_samples
	Each of the points again creats an EPS
	
2. Clusters are made using starting point
	- leading to core points
	- Border points 
	
	The process of using core points and border points grows until we reach convergence


Most of the industry problems are slolved with KMeans, Hierarchial and DBScan
